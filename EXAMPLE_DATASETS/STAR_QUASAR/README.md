Star-Quasar Classification Based on SDSS Photometry

---

A classic problem in survey astronomy is differentiating stars from quasars. The former are local, generally within the Milky Way; the latter are far, far from the Milky Way. The former are radiating balls of gas with luminosities akin to those of the Sun; the latter are radiating nuclei of galaxies where supermassive black holes are gobbling up matter at a prodigious rate, with luminosities that range up to those of thousands of Milky Ways. But both look like points of light on a telescopic image. (Hence the name "quasar," from "quasi-stellar object.") 

The spectra of stars and quasars (i.e., the luminosities as a function of wavelength) look very different, but if all we have is photometry (aka very-low-resolution spectra, with brightnesses recorded in five wide wavelength bins), then one has to put a bit of work to classify the objects correctly.

In this dataset (Star_Quasar.csv or .Rdata), you are given photometry (u, g, r, i, and z band magnitudes) for 500 quasars and 500 stars. Can you learn a classifier with good predictive accuracy?
