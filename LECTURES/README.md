This directory contains 36-290 lectures in individual R Markdown files.

The directory is currently incomplete (and keep in mind that the files here
may be edited in the future for consistency of appearance, to add slides,
etc., etc.). I intend to add lectures on

- the use of validation datasets when tuning parameters

- unsupervised learning: K means, hierarchical clustering

- principal components analysis

- generalized additive models

- K nearest neighbors

- multinomial logistic regression
